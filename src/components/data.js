    description: 'After recently completing a course on machine code and instruction set architecture (ISA), I used my understanding of computer and operating systems to implement a cache simulator that reproduces a computerâ€™s efficient data storage system. The project necessitated an understanding of how computers encode where to read and write data based on the address. I also learned about the relative merits of different cache structures and an LRU scheme. Additionally, I also programmed my custom Unix shell, which executes like Bash with added functionalities. This project used a range of system and library calls in C, as well as a particular focus on accounting for all command-line input variants, which required comprehensive white-box testing of all edge-cases.
